Given a 2D grid of size m x n and an integer k. You need to shift the grid k times.

In one shift operation:

Element at grid[i][j] moves to grid[i][j + 1].
Element at grid[i][n - 1] moves to grid[i + 1][0].
Element at grid[m - 1][n - 1] moves to grid[0][0].
Return the 2D grid after applying shift operation k times.

 

Example 1:

<img width="654" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c776f7ba-2020-417d-8558-19f6e0bf9e43" />


Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
Output: [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]
Example 2:

<img width="624" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0702801-0bbc-4ac8-bb48-b618f69a6054" />


Input: grid = [[3,8,1,9],[19,7,2,5],[4,6,11,10],[12,0,21,13]], k = 4
Output: [[12,0,21,13],[3,8,1,9],[19,7,2,5],[4,6,11,10]]
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 9
Output: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m <= 50
1 <= n <= 50
-1000 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000
0 <= k <= 100
